# browser_to_foreground_and_new_tab
Bring your browser (now workds for BRAVE) to the foreground and open new tab in it.

Imagine, you have many different windows opened, and you use browser often to search for something on internet, you dont want to always search where is your browser window located, then after you found it, click new tab button and start search (via top panel) or even open some search web, like google and then start search. This is quite a big steps if you use search often.

This small application (which can be used in mouse button) will find your browser, and put it to foreground, and immadiately will open new tab in it, like using CTRL+T. It is convenient, that you can immediately start typing for seach in is set search engine, like google, and also if you use some dials, you can open those dials right away.

Antivirus:
Since program is doing some windows manipulation (like bring browser into foreground, it might be marked as a virus). 
You might want to add folder with program to exceptions in your antivirus.
